# This script is builds Kudu using Impala's toolchain components. It accomplishes this
# by downloading Impala's toolchain using bootstrap_toolchain.py, then sets up a variety
# of compiler related environment variables and does a full build of Kudu and its
# thirdparty. This script requires IMPALA_HOME to be set. This script also requires the
# following environment variables:
# KUDU_HOME - location of the Kudu source. This will be modified.
# KUDU_FOR_IMPALA_OUTPUT_DIR - destination directory for the Kudu tarball
# The script will generate a tarball named kudu-${IMPALA_KUDU_VERSION}.tar.gz in the
# specified output directory.

  # Typically, for Kudu builds, we just put /usr/local/lib/ccache on the path,

  # Impala toolchain, we create wrappers.  Adding the gcc bin/ directory to
  # PATH (after /usr/local/lib/ccache but before other compilers) didn't work
  # because something in third-party invokes plain "cc" which doesn't exist in
  # the GCC directory. Using "CC='ccache .../gcc'" doesn't work because the
  # pre-flight check assumes that CC is one binary, rather than two arguments,
  # and that's a reasonable thing for it to assume.
