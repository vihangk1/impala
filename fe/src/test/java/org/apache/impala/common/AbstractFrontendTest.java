/**
 * Base Unit test class that manages the Frontend fixture
 * to initialize and shut down the front-end, and to remove any
 * temporary tables created by the test. Derive tests from this class
 * if the test does anything "special." Derive from
 * {@link FrontendTestBase} for routine tests that can leverage the
 * many default functions available.
 *
 * A special test is one that:
 *
 * * Needs specialized query options.
 * * Needs specialized query handling, such as inspecting bits of the
 *   AST, decorated AST or query plan.
 *
 * In these cases, use the fixtures directly as they provide more control
 * than do the generic methods in FrontendTestBase.
