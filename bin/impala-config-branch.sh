# cannot rely on a fully-formed GBN to build against, because it is creating that GBN.

# is using for this build. The below section is where the variables are filled in for
# the CDP build.
#
# Note: The set_snapshot_versions Jenkins job also uses text replacements, so the
# following versions will be updated with SNAPSHOT versions. However, Impala does not
# use these SNAPSHOT versions. Instead, Impala gets version from a CDP GBN.

# 1. If $GLOBAL_BUILD_NUMBER is set, use that for $CDP_GBN.
# 2. If $CDP_GBN is set, use that.
# 3. If $IMPALA_HOME/toolchain/cdp_components/cdp-gbn-${CDP_VERSION}.sh exists, source it
#    to set $CDP_GBN. This will cause subsequent builds in the same $IMPALA_HOME
#    to continue using the same cdp components.
# 4. Query BuildDB for the latest official CDP build for ${CDP_VERSION}, and use that.
#    The result is cached in cdp-gbn-${CDP_VERSION}.sh so that a workspace
#    continues to use the same components.
# In addition to being used by bin/bootstrap-toolchain.sh to download the
# tarballs to support the minicluster, CDP_GBN is used to set CDP_MAVEN_REPOSITORY
# to the maven repository from that GBN (used in impala-parent/pom.xml).
